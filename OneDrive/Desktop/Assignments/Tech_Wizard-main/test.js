creating new thread for showing GST per SKU in Invoice selected items... rounding off total amount via checkbox ...GST breakdown in invoice creation page and then  finally  saving these rounding off in BE orders and making sure ..GST is passed

and then lastly updating invoice with these amount and making invoice better
ChatGPT
To implement GST per SKU display, rounding off the total amount with a checkbox, GST breakdown in the invoice creation page, and updating invoices with rounded-off amounts while ensuring proper backend integration, here's a systematic approach:

Frontend Tasks
1. GST per SKU in InvoiceSelectedItemsTable
File: InvoiceSelectedItemsTable.js
Add a new column to display GST per SKU.
Update the render function to calculate and display GST based on the SKU price and GST percentage.
Ensure alignment with the table's current structure and style from tailwind.config.js.
2. Rounding Off Total Amount via Checkbox
Files: InvoiceSelectedItemsTable.js, Modal.js, Toast.js
Add a checkbox to the footer or summary section of the invoice.
Use Math.round() for the rounding logic and reflect it in the total amount display.
Integrate a toast notification (Toast.js) to inform the user when rounding is applied.
3. GST Breakdown in Invoice Creation Page
File: [orderId].js
Add a section displaying:
Total GST (sum of GST for all SKUs).
Taxable amount (subtotal before GST).
Tax slab details if applicable.
Style the section using Tailwind classes (tailwind.config.js).
Backend Tasks
1. Save Rounding-Off Information in Orders
File: SalesInvoiceProvider.js
Update the saveInvoice function to include:
A flag for rounding (isRounded).
Adjusted total amount after rounding.
2. Pass GST Information to Backend
Ensure the createOrder or updateOrder API call includes:
GST per SKU.
Total GST breakdown.
Rounding-off details.
3. Update Backend APIs
Files: SalesInvoiceProvider.js, index.js
Verify the API schema supports:
Rounding flag.
Adjusted amounts.
GST breakdown (both per SKU and total).
Invoice Updates
1. Display Updates
Enhance invoice formatting to include:
GST breakdown and total amount.
Rounded-off amount (if applied).
Reflect these changes in the downloadable or printable invoice (Button.js for actions).
2. Styling Improvements
Use Tailwind configurations to ensure visual consistency:
Adjust margins and padding for the GST section.
Highlight rounded-off amounts (e.g., bold or colored text).
Testing and Validation
End-to-End Testing:

Verify GST calculations per SKU.
Test rounding logic across different totals.
Check backend API calls for accurate data passing.
UI/UX Feedback:

Validate the new invoice layout with stakeholders.
Adjust based on user feedback to ensure clarity.
Implementation Roadmap
Frontend Changes: Display GST per SKU and implement checkbox logic.
Backend Integration: Update APIs for rounding and GST data.
Testing: Ensure all changes work seamlessly with the existing POS system.
Deployment: Roll out incrementally to monitor stability.
Would you like to start with any specific part of the implementation, or shall I dive into the code adjustments for the outlined steps?

Context for Next Thread
Learnings from This Thread:
Prioritize clear state management and error handling (e.g., toast, cartItems).
Provide user feedback for all operations (e.g., SHOW_TOAST for success and error cases).
Address temporary fixes (e.g., cart cleanup) with TODO notes for future improvements.
Ensure responsive and user-friendly UI/UX for tables and input fields.
Goals for Next Thread:
Round-Off Logic:

Implement a checkbox to enable or disable round-off.
Allow manual adjustments to increase or decrease the total price while ensuring taxes remain unchanged.
GST per SKU in Table:

Display the total GST calculated per SKU directly in the selected SKUs table.
Save the GST breakdown in the state for future use.
GST Breakdown in Invoice Summary:

Add a detailed breakdown of GST (e.g., CGST, SGST, IGST) in the invoice summary.
Ensure the data is dynamically calculated and displayed after syncing with the backend.

I have added all the required project files for the tasks (To implement GST per SKU display, rounding off the total amount with a checkbox, GST breakdown in the invoice creation page) in project files ..just scan it

and can you create two canvas SalesInvoiceProvider 1 and SalesInvoiceProvider 2 ..as the final content is big ...will put it two sepearte canvas and for the changes needed in this file ...you can give here in text

and two other canvas you need to create one for InvoiceItemManager and InvoiceSelectedItemsTable ...changes in any other file we can do in canvas

if aligned create canvas as per instructions!! thanks in advance
